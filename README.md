# Stage 3A - Traffic Control

Research Intership project at UC Berkeley. For more details on the problem and our results, please check our report.

**Objective**: The objective was to build an intelligent traffic lights controller, capable of adapting the amount of green / red time for each lane as a function of the influc of vehicles.

**Techniques**: We model the traffic lights controller as a neural network trained via Reinforcement Learning methods. For this, a simple traffic simulator (Beats2) was used to simulate traffic and "rewards".

**Conclusions**: From our experiments, our adaptive traffic controller was observed to outperform fixed-time controllers by a large margin, thus providing a better solution to the problem of efficient traffic management.
